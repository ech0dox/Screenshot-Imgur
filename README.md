# Screenshot Imgur

Well, this is a small utility to upload images to Imgur. Build using Python2, Imgur's API, scrot, and xsel.

Update apikey and clientkey to your keys from [Imgur](http://api.imgur.com/oauth2/addclient) in the source file.

Python2 - because I'm shit at python and I'm still learning it
Imgur's API - ...
scrot - to create the Screenshot
xsel - to save the url to clipboard

That's about all for now, feel free to make better as I'm sure I will in the future.

# Requirements
- Python2
- Scrot
- xsel
- Imgur API Keys
- A Brain
